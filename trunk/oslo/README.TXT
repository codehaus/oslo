In lack of more formal documentation at the moment

To try out the system, do the following steps
1. Install Maven
2. Open two windows (shells or cmd's)
3. Go to the directory where you downloaded Oslo
4. Type

      maven oslo:start:server

   This should start the server process that collects the
   information generated by our sample applicaton
5. Go to the second window you opened and type (from the same
   directory as where you started the server)

      maven oslo:execute:sample

   This executes the sample application and providing that the server
   is up and running, feeds the data to it.

6. After running the sample application, type the following on the command
   prompt

      ./run-console.sh

   This will execute the console that lets you manipulate the stored data in
   the server.

   When you get the COMMAND:> prompt, type HELP to see available options.

Thats it

It will be better documented, tested and evolved in due course.
